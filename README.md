# Vault Hunters Jewel Sorting

Tired of having random order of jewels in RS/AE2 grid or in your inventory after sorting by name? Then this client-side mod is made for you.

This mod does not add any new blocks. It just integrates into RS, AE2, and Quark and uses their `Sort by Name` to respect Vault Hunters Jewel data.

Jewels will be in order by:
- their name ( Chipped, Flawless, and Perfect)
- number of affixes
- affix value (if it has only 1 affix)
- jewel size
- jewel level
